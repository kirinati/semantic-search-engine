# semantic-search-engine
Hello!
Revanth here; I'm a bachelor's student at NIT Rourkela, and I enjoy sports and anime. I'm grateful for this opportunity, and working on this project taught me a lot of things that made me want to create my own search engine. Hopefully, I can learn from my mistakes. Since I intend to work on NLP concepts in the future, I am confident that this is the right step for my career. It would also be a pleasure for me to collaborate with Phia on this.
I'm grateful.
