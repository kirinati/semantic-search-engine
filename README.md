# semantic-search-engine
Hello!
## Revanth here; I'm a bachelor's student at NIT Rourkela, and I enjoy sports and anime. I'm grateful for this opportunity, and working on this project taught me a lot of things that made me want to create my own search engine. Hopefully, I can learn from my mistakes. Since I intend to work on NLP concepts in the future, I am confident that this is the right step for my career. It would also be a pleasure for me to collaborate with Phia on this.
## I'm grateful.
## I have used the pinecone datset as my vector database and I have incorporated the multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 multimodel this retriever we used to generate context embeddings is optimized for cosine similarity and outputs 384-dimension vectors. This model uses 'cosine' as a similarity metric, and then we use "deepset/electra-base-squad2" to find similar answers as it generates context and uses similarity search algortihms to find answers. And finally for the user interface i used streamlit and ngrok
